# employee-management-app

This app frontend is built with Angular framework, while the backend was built with Node, Express and MongoDB database.

To view the frontend, run the below command on your terminal:

     Ng serve 
     
 To start the CRUD operation, connect to the database.
      cd backend 
   
 Start the server
 
      node server.js
      
Now you can register, edit and delete an employee from the app.
